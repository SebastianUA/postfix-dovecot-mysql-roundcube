# Default password scheme, must be a string.
#
#   - Available schemes for LDAP backend: BCRYPT, SSHA, PLAIN.
#   - Available schemes for SQL backend: BCRYPT, SSHA, MD5, PLAIN-MD5 (without salt), PLAIN.
#
# Recommended schemes in specified order:
#
#   BCRYPT -> SSHA -> MD5
#
# WARNING: Don't use PLAIN-MD5, PLAIN, they're easy to crack.
#
# Important notes:
#
#   - Password length and complexity are probably more important then a strong
#     crypt algorithm.
#
#   - BCRYPT: *) must be supported by your system's libc.
#                You can get available algorithms with command 'doveadm pw -l'
#                ('BLF-CRYPT' is BCRYPT).
#                Unfortunately, most Linux distributions doesn't support it,
#                but OpenBSD supports it.
#
#             *) BCRYPT is slower than SSHA512, SSHA, MD5.
#                But, "Speed is exactly what you don't want in a password hash function."
#
#   - SSHA512: requires Dovecot-2.0 (and later) and Python-2.5 (and later).
#              If you're running Python-2.4, iRedAdmin will generate SSHA hash
#              instead of SSHA512. But if you're running Dovecot-1.x, user
#              authentication will fail.
#
#   - CRAM-MD5: Currently works with SQL backends, but not LDAP.
#
# Passwords of new mail accounts will be crypted by specified scheme.
# Sample password format:
#
# - BCRYPT: {CRYPT}$2a$05$TKnXV39M3uJ4o.AbY1HbjeAval9bunHbxd0.6Qn782yKoBjTEBXTe
#           NOTE: Use prefix '{CRYPT}' instead of '{BLF-CRYPT}'.

# - SSHA: {SSHA}bfxqKqOOKODJw/bGqMo54f9Q/iOvQoftOQrqWA==
# - CRAM-MD5: {CRAM-MD5}465076e1c95ac134fc2ba88ad617b6660958f388d60423504ee7c46ce44be8b4
# - MD5: $1$ozdpg0V0$0fb643pVsPtHVPX8mCZYW/
